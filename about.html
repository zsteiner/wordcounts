                            	<p>Jul 31, 2015</p>
                            	<p>Back in the olden days of 2008, while working on a conference submission (and thus very sensitive to word counts), I wrote a <a href="http://zachsteiner.com/2008/09/presidential-word-counts/">blog post</a> about word counts on campaign policy statements. I noticed there was a huge range of ink spilled on various issues between the two candidates at the time. I intended to do a follow up in 2012, but I was otherwise occupied during the 2012 election (dissertation, moving, etc.). However, 2016 is proving to be much more interesting election cycle. There is a huge field of very diverse candidates ranging from experienced politicians to relative unknowns. I decided to expand the concept as a data visualization. As a comparison, 2008 versions of McCain and Obama and 2012 version of Romney (actually late 2011, for fairer comparison to the 2016 crop) are included as reference. Immediately noticeable is the fact that many candidates have a lot written already on issues, whereas eight have no policy/issue offerings on their website. This does not seem to be a partisan divide; there are verbose and laconic candidates from both parties. Granted this is still early in the election cycle and many of the campaigns are still nascent. I will update the underlying data in a few months as candidates join, leave, or update their sites.</p>
                            	
                            	<p>My methodology is simple: I copied and pasted the pages into a word processor and used the word count feature. For those candidates that offer a summary and a full policy policy paper (typically as a PDF or eBook download), I use the full paper text giving Romney's economic tome an impressive 39,987 length. The number of issues is the count of issues covered, rather than the count of my categories. Averages are for For instance, I include the tax and job issues are under the umbrella of Economy and defense spending or Iran policy get included with Foreign Policy. A lot of disparate issues get lumped into Social Issues&mdash;including criminal justice, 2nd Amendment, voting rights, income inequality, marriage equality, religious liberty, etc.</p>
                            	
                            	<p>You will see all of the current candidates on the left sidebar. You can toggle as many candidates for comparisons. The buttons below the chart allow you to switch between word counts per issue, total issues covered, and average words overall. As for the issues, I kept the same categories from 2008. Except, I removed Iraq as an issue and added the environment. Also, I noticed that every candidate, whether they had policy information or not, devoted a section of their site to biography. I included word counts for those as well.</p>

                            	<p>My raw data can be examined for accuracy: <a href="data/issues.json">Issues</a>, <a href="data/count.json">Issue Counts</a>, and <a href="data/average.json">Average Word Counts</a>. All are in JSON format.</p>

                                <p>Romney 2012 had two massive policy papers outlining economic and foreign policies, thus the much larger word counts. Economic policy was divided into 7 individual issues. I broke out Energy.</p>
                                                                
                                <p>Clinton covers Policy in “Four Fights” section. Economy is “Building an economy for tomorrow”. Foreign Policy is covered in “Defending America and our core values.”</p>
                                
                                <p>Christie has four PDF policy papers. “Entitlement Reform” is mainly about Medicare and Medicaid so I included it in Health Care, but it could also be included under Economy. Christie about section is a video with photo collage with captions.</p>
                                
                                <p>Marco Rubio’s larger word count for Foreign Policy comes from a series of op-ed articles on his site ranging from “Cuba”, “Iran”, “Iran, Part 2”,  “Europe”, “Israel”, and “Defense Spending”. These were previously published in various magazines and websites.</p>
                                
                                <p>Santorum has not officially released his economic plan as of the end of July, but the site teases that is coming. I will update when it is published.</p>
                                
                                <p>For Jim Webb, I combined “Economic Fairness” and “National Infrastructure” for economy.</p>
                                <p>I updated the biography word counts for 2008 McCain and Obama from <a href="http://archive.org">archive.org</a> cached versions of their sites.</p>
